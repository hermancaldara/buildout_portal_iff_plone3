This document provides instructions for upgrading from Plone 2.5.x or
earlier (non-buildout) Plone 3.2 installations. To upgrade a buildout-based
installation, see the "Updating After Installation" section of the Unified
Installer README.txt.

Upgrade Instructions
====================
Installer-based automatic upgrades are not supported. To upgrade your
site, you will need to complete the following steps:

Major Version Upgrade (2.5.x to 3.3.5.x)
--------------------------------------

1) Install Plone with the Unified Installer (default location: /usr/local/Plone)

2) Stop the existing Plone instance (default location /usr/local/Plone-2.5)
	>> sudo /usr/local/Plone-2.5/zeocluster/bin/shutdowncluster.sh

3) Copy your Data.fs file from /usr/local/Plone-2.5/zeocluster/server/var/Data.fs to
   /usr/local/Plone/instance_name/var/filestorage/
   "instance_name" will be zinstance or zeocluster for a typical install.

   >> cp /usr/local/Plone-2.5/zeocluster/server/var/Data.fs /usr/local/Plone/zeocluster/var/filestorage/Data.fs

   (Make sure the target Data.fs has "plone" for an owner.)

4) Migrate any third-party or custom products to the new setup
	>> cp -r /usr/local/Plone-2.5/zeocluster/Products/<CUSTOM_PRODUCT> \
	   /usr/local/Plone/instance_name/products/<CUSTOM_PRODUCT>

   Note that many products will need updates to work with 3.x. Check
   plone.org/products for latest versions. Note that you may also install
   add-on products in your new install by adding URLs to your buildout.cfg
   productdistros section.

5) Start the new Plone instance at /usr/local/Plone/instance_name

6) Click the 'Upgrade' button in the 'Migrate' tab in portal_migration (ZMI).

7) Click the 'Upgrade' button in the 'Version Migration' tab in portal_atct (ZMI).

8) Reinstall updated products in Plone at Site Setup -> Add/Remove
   Products (or via portal_quickinstaller in ZMI)

Please note that the administrative passwords will be those of the old install
-- not the new. You may wish to update adminPassword.txt to reflect the change.

Note: Instructions on how to upgrade from versions prior to Plone 2.5 are beyond
the scope of this document.


Minor Version Update (For example, 3.2 to 3.3.5)
----------------------------------------------------

The 3.2 Unified Installer installs to different locations depending on your
choices of root/non-root, zeo/standalone configurations.

Begin by locating your installation. Typical locations are:

    root:            /usr/local/Plone
    non-root:        $HOME/Plone

Stop Zope and back up the *entire* installation.

If your previous installation is buildout-based
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    

Change into your installation's instance directory (typically zinstance
or zeocluster).

Edit buildout.cfg to specify version 3.3.5 and to load versions.cfg from
a URL.

Run the command:

    bin/buildout -n

Use "sudo" if this is a root install. The "-n" flag forces buildout into
"newest" mode and it will search for new versions.

If your instance does not update, check to see if your buildout.cfg file
has is using an old versions.cfg URL.

Correct the versions and run buildout again. (It may be necessary to delete
.installed.cfg.)

Now, start your instance as usual. Visit the Zope Management Interface and
for every Plone site in your Zope instance, visit portal_migration and
migrate your data to the latest release.

If your previous installation is not buildout-based
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    

Begin by locating your Data.fs file. Typical locations are:

    root, ZEO:            /usr/local/Plone-3.0/zeocluster/server/var/Data.fs
    root, standalone:     /usr/local/Plone-3.0/zinstance/var/Data.fs
    non-root, ZEO:        $HOME/Plone-3.0/zeocluster/server/var/Data.fs
    non-root, standalone: $HOME/Plone-3.0/zinstance/var/Data.fs

Next, locate your instance Products directory. Typical locations are:

    root, ZEO:            /usr/local/Plone-3.0/zeocluster/Products
    root, standalone:     /usr/local/Plone-3.0/zinstance/Products
    non-root, ZEO:        $HOME/Plone-3.0/zeocluster/Products
    non-root, standalone: $HOME/Plone-3.0/zinstance/Products

1) Stop your existing Plone install using the shutdown instructions in
   adminPassword.txt.

2) Install Plone 3.2.x with the Unified Installer. Determine the location of your
   new Data.fs and instance Products.
   
3) Copy the old Data.fs to replace the newly installed one. Make sure it is
   owned by the "plone" user id.
   
4) Copy any add-on products (ones not included in the Plone installation) in
   your old instance Products directory to your new instance Products directory.
   You may wish to take this opportunity to look for update Products and install
   them in place of old ones. Better: install add-on products by adding URLs to
   your buildout.cfg's productdistros section.

5) Start the new Plone instance via the instructions in the new
   adminPassword.txt file.

7) Click the 'Upgrade' button in the 'Migrate' tab in portal_migration (ZMI).

8) Reinstall updated products in Plone at Site Setup -> Add/Remove
   Products (or via portal_quickinstaller in ZMI)

Please note that the administrative passwords will be those of the old install
-- not the new. You may wish to update adminPassword.txt to reflect the change.
