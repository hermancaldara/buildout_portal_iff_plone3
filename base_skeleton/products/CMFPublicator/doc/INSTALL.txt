CMFPublicator install

  1. Unpack the tarball. 

  2. Copy or link the 'CMFPublicator' directory into the 'Products'
     directory of your INSTANCE_HOME / SOFTWARE_HOME.

  3. Restart Zope.

  4. Create an External Method in the root of your CMF or Plone Site:

    id:             install_configuration
    Module Name:    CMFPublicator.install
    Function Name:  install

    Click on the External Method you've just created and select the test tab.
    Hopefully the method will give some output about the installation process.

    or:

    * Use the CMFQuickInstallerTool to install it. (More easy, fast
      and clean!) ;-)
