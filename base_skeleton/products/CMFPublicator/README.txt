CMFPublicator readme

 This product was born at 2004/01/15 and provide a tool used to
 do static content publication in CMF and Plone sites. It broke
 with CMF's idea of free showing published content according to 
 pre-defined rules, giving to the reviewer power  to choose just the 
 objects he wants to show in the portlets.

Usage

 When you have followed the doc/INSTALL.txt file and installed CMFPublicator
 succesfully, you must setup which publication boxes the portal will have:

  1. Go to ZMI of your portal root

  2. Go to the 'portal_publicator' tool

  3. There are a tab containing the settings for configuration:

     The 'Configuration' tab contains the fields to insert new publication
     boxes.

     Make one publication box to each portlet box that you want to have.

  4. Each publication box created needs an integrated portlet_interface to
     interact with us. This interface can be customized in default
     portal_skins folder.

     Follows the idea of this portlet to make and customize others, and
     have fun! ;-)
